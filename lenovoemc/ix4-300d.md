# LenovoEMC ix4-300d Notes

The LenovoEMC ix4-300d is a small 4-bay NAS based on Armada XP dual-core 78230 ARMv7 CPU.

component | model
:---|:---
CPU | Marvell PJ4Bv7 Processor rev 2 (v7l)
Flash | K9K8G08U0E Samsung 1GB SLC flash (48-pin TSOP-1)
RAM | 2 x 256MB Nanya NT5CB128M16FP-DI DDR3 SDRAM (512MB total)
SATA | Marvell 88SX7042-BDU1
Ethernet | 2 x Marvell 88E1318-NNB2 Gigabit Ethernet
USB 3.0 | Renesas D720200AF1 PCI-E controller
RTC | NXP 8563T (`pcf8563` - at I2C address 0-0051)
Fan/LED Control | ADT7473ARQZ (`adt7473` at I2C address 0-002e)
LCD Control | NXP 74HC165D (connected to the SPI bus, but does not appear in `/proc/sys/bus/spi`). Controls power, sys, sys-fail and hdd-fail LEDs; the HDD LED is controlled by a CPU GPIO instead.

# LEDs

As all LEDs are configured using `gpio-led` you can use all the standard linux `gpio-led` interface and triggers (see `/sys/class/led`).

```
echo 1 > /sys/class/leds/ix4-300d:sysfail:red/brightness
```

## Controlling brightness

The whole front panel brightness (includng LCD and all leds) are controlled by `pwm` brightness through `pwm3` on the I2C (see `/sys/class/i2c-0/0-0ée/pwm3` where you can simply `cat` 0 thru 255 to `pwm3`))

```
dim the lights echo 30 > /sys/class/i2c-adapter/i2c-0/0-002e/pwm3
```

## Temperature

`hmon0` & `hmon1` contains sensors and temp values for differents parts of the NAS. Alternatively you can check the I2C, e.q. for cpu:

```
echo "scale=0; cat /sys/class/i2c-adapter/i2c-0/0-002e/temp1_input/1000" | bc
````

## Fans

Fans are controlled though I2C using `pwm1` Target temperatures should be to keep the HDD <41°C, case <32°C & CPU<62°C.

Auto PWM for fan speed only reacts to CPU temperature & automatic PWM:

```
echo 1 > /sys/class/i2c-adapter/i2c-0/0-002e/pwm1_auto_channels_temp
echo 2 > /sys/class/i2c-adapter/i2c-0/0-002e/pwm1_enable
```

Minimum temperature for PWM:

```
echo 57000 > /sys/class/i2c-adapter/i2c-0/0-002e/temp1_auto_point1_temp
````

Maximum temperature for PWM:

```
echo 90000 > /sys/class/i2c-adapter/i2c-0/0-002e/temp1_auto_point2_temp
```

PWM minimum:

```
echo 75 > /sys/class/i2c-adapter/i2c-0/0-002e/pwm1_auto_point1_pwm
````

PWM maximum:

```
echo 180 > /sys/class/i2c-adapter/i2c-0/0-002e/pwm1_auto_point2_pwm
```

## LCD Screen

The LCD is a 128x64 pixel monchrome display. LCD drivers through RS, E, RW, S, and 8-bit `gpio`.
